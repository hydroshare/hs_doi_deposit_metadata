# HydroShare DOI Deposit Metadata

This repository provides documentation for HydroShare's implementation of deposit metadata for registration of digital object identifiers (DOIs) for published resources. The HydroShare production system is at [https://www.hydroshare.org](https://www.hydroshare.org).

## Introduction

HydroShare currently uses [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) to register DOIs for published resources. When a DOI is registered, the DOI registration system allows metadata to be deposited which can then be queried by anyone who has the DOI. In this repository we describe how HydroShare's resource metadata is mapped to Crossref's deposit metadata schema. 

This repository was created to document HydroShare's deposit metadata implementation, and may be changed depending on HydroShare's use of DOI registration system.
